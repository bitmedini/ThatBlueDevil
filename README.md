### U-um Hello! 👋

I'm **ThatBlueDevil**, you know.. my horns are blue.

I came to github to host all my private projects to show off to my friends, pretty cool huh.

If your interested and willing to read more I'll list some stuff!

  ● Right now I'm working on a big project called Saurus, a discord moderation bot.
  
  ● Currently I'm learning CSS/HTML, Java, and Elixir!
  
  ● I play minecraft sometimes when I'm bored.
  
  ● You can ask me about anything, just nothing weird..
  
  ● You can reach me by my discord or v3rmillion!

  ● I'm a her/she! Don't know why you would like to know that but ok.
  
  ● Fun fact! I hate talking to people because I know I'll be judged for everything I say.
